# Playground 🏖️

This is my personal coding sandbox — a place to learn, practice, and experiment with new ideas.  
Expect random snippets, small projects, and experiments in different languages and frameworks.

## 🛠 What you'll find here

- Algorithm & data structure practice
- Experiments with new frameworks/libraries
- Small utility scripts
- Random coding ideas and prototypes

## 💡 Purpose

This repo is not about polished projects — it's about learning by doing.  
Some code may be messy, unfinished, or experimental, and that's the point! 🚀
